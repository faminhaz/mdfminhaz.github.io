    <h2> What you need to know about me? </h2>

 <p>In the year of 2015, the most tough decesion I had to make was to come to college. It was never easy ans still not easy for me to continue college now. Because  I am the only bread earner for the family. It is never easy to live in NYC without enough money. I have been a full time student and a full time worker at the same time. I have successfully completed my AS degree in computer scince from Medgar Evers coleg and now I am working on to get my bachelor degree. whice I am hoping to complete by may 2021.
